#Description about the webpage

1) Here, we are using YouTube Api to fetch the records as per input and display them in a horizontally paginated list.
2) Max records to fetch at a time is 15.
3) No Frameworks are used such as bootstrap, No JavaScript libraries are used such as jQuery.                    
4) For each video fetched there is minimal information provided such as title, description, published date, author name etc.
5) Depending upon the page size the record’s displayed on the screen are paginated. If the page size decreases, then the video’s displayed will become less and rest of them will be paginated with a page number.
